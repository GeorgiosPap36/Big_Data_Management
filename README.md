# Key Value Store

This repository contains the final project developed for the master's course "Big Data Management". The goal of the project was to create a Key-Value store using the Trie data structure. Specifically, the project involved creating the following components:

1. **Data Generator**: A tool to produce keys and values that populate the Trie.

2. **Client**: A client capable of connecting to multiple servers to edit or retrieve values stored in the data structure.

3. **Server**: A server that listens for queries from the client and responds accordingly.
